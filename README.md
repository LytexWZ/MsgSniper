# MsgSniper
A simple overlay for discord that snipes messages and allows you to copy the username

# Usage
Copy the code and paste it into your discord browser console

# Other info
I will add a loader in a next update and the discord sound to notify a log was created.
This project was made while in a call with Isaac to fix an issue we had with a discord game server, that's why it is so specific with the username parsing, will add fallback in a later update
